## Deployment
AdminAccess is deployed on Heroku. You can access the live application [here](https://adminaccess-f697b23e85fa.herokuapp.com/).

## Installation
To get started with AdminAccess, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kyoriku/AdminAccess.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.
    ```bash
    cd AdminAccess
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies for both the client (front-end) and server (back-end) sides.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the server directory and fill in your database credentials.
    ```bash
    DB_NAME='your_database_name'
    DB_USER='your_MySQL_username'
    DB_PASSWORD='your_MySQL_password'
    SESSION_SECRET='your_session_secret'
    ADMIN_USERNAME='your_admin_username'
    ADMIN_EMAIL='your_admin_email_address'
    ADMIN_PASSWORD='your_admin_password'
    ```

5. Set up MySQL database.
    - **Using MySQL Workbench:**
      - Open MySQL Workbench and connect to your MySQL server.
      - Create a new schema/database (if it doesn't exist already) by clicking on the "Create a new schema in the connected server" icon or through the "File" > "New Model" menu.
      - Name the schema/database with the desired name, e.g., `your_database_name`.
      - Execute the schema provided in the `db/schema.sql` file within the created schema/database to set up the necessary tables and structure.

    - **Using MySQL Command Line:**
      - Log into MySQL and create the necessary database by executing the schema provided in the `db/schema.sql` file. Replace `<username>` with your MySQL username.
      ```bash
      mysql -u <username> -p
      source db/schema.sql
      quit 
      ```

6. Seed the database.
    ```bash
    npm run seed
    ```

## Usage
1. Once dependencies are installed, the environment variables are created, and the database is set up: navigate to the root directory of the project and start the server.
    ```bash
    npm run develop
    ```
    This command initiates both the server and client development environments concurrently. It will launch the development server and open AdminAccess in your default web browser. If not, navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
